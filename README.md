# `XtalsPyTools.jl`

A repository of Python-dependent tools for working with [`Xtals.jl`](https://github.com/SimonEnsemble/Xtals.jl)

`Xtals` is a pure-Julia package for reading/writing/editing crystal structures.
Some higher-level features were previously dependent on Python packages; those have been moved here.
